Long method and Long class. These code smells often occurs in OOP projects, the long method and the long class will confuse other developers with the functionality of the method or class. The solution that I can suggest is to apply the rules in the SOLID principle, namely the single responsibility principle where each class only has one responsibility. When a class has one responsibility, the method and class writing will not be too long so that it is more developer friendly
